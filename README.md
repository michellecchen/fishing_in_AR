# Fishing in Augmented Reality

## ðŸŽ£ Description

A little fishing minigame made as a foray into mobile AR development.

Players can *CAST* their fishing rod, and *REEL* it in when the time is right, to catch fish. Catches are chained successively: players catch larger and larger fish with each successful catch. Failed catches reset players back down to the teensiest fish.
